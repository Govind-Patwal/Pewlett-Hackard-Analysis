# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview

I have been tasked to help Bobby, an up and coming HR analyst, for  ***Pewlett Hackard***, a large company boasting several thousand employees. As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett Hackard is looking toward the future in 2 ways.
1) First, it's offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria
2) Second, it's starting to think which positions will need to be filled in the near future. The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings. What would happen to a company if they didn't look ahead and prepare for this many vacancies? It probably won't be pretty. 

Bobby, specifically, needs to find answers to the following questions.
* Who will be retiring in the next few years?  and 
* How many positions will Pewlett Packard need to fill?

This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package. The employee data Bobby needs is only available in the form of 6 CSVs because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data. But now they have finally decide to update their methods and insted use SQL, a definite upgrade considering the amount of data. 

My task is to help Bobby build an employee database with SQL by applying my data modelling, engineering and analysis skills.

## Purpose of this Analysis
As a part of my past assignment at Pewlett Hackard, I analysed various factors and created the following tables.
1. Retirement eligibility
2. retirement_info
3. current_emp
4. number_of_employees_retiring_per_department
5. manager_info
6. dept_info

Now Bobby's manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, we’ll write a report that summarizes our analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Analysis Results

## Summary

Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
